#  ACT CW2: Analysing the Correlation Between the Quality & Price of a Book & Whether an Author Guarantees an Audience:
This data science project is based on the ideas of critical and commercial hits and flops. The pop culture landscape with entertainment typically revolves around well known faces with companies banking on them to generate income for a given project.

The only drawback to this method of thinking is that most productions involve hundreds to thousands of people with budgets ballooning to inlcude everyone involved to pay and credit them for their work. While I could have used a dataset to reflect this industry,
I chose to focus on one that sole depends on at least one singular person and at most, two people. What I wanted to study was whether an author's name was enough to guarantee an audience as well as a high price tag.

## Structure of Project:

This project consists of three Jupyter notebooks as well as a python file containing all my functions which will be called to analyse this question using a traditional approach as well as a neural network approach to see whether an author can rely on themselves to 
generate revenue for their projects. Each notebook can be run easily by running each coding cell to see the output displayed. 

For further analysis, I will assess whether pre-training affects the performance of the neural network. This question will allow me to represent whether a person can be biased into thinkning that a given author is more successful on one storefront than another. 

The dependencies that are required will be listed in the dependencies.txt file.
